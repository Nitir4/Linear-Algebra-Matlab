    ImageCompressionApp_mech505 - Interactive code for image compression using PCA or SVD (no GUI implementation)
    This code lets you:
     1. Load an image (JPG, PNG, BMP, etc.)
     2. Choose to work in RGB (color) or grayscale mode
     3. Compress the image using either PCA or SVD
     4. Compare both methods and analyze their performance
     5. Visualize results and metrics, and optionally save the output image



     ImageCompressionGUI - GUI implementation of the ImageCompressionApp_mech505 while not a full blown .mlapp it does some of the GUI in .m file
