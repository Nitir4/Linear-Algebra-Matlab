# Linear Algebra Matlab Projects

Welcome! This repository contains my projects from my 2nd semester linear algebra course. Here, you’ll find practical MATLAB code that brings core linear algebra concepts to life, using image processing, noise filtering and face recognition.

## Folders and Their Contents

### 1. noise_filtering
Scripts and a simple GUI for denoising images or matrices using PCA and SVD.  
See `noise_filtering/README.md` for details.

### 2. image_compression
Scripts and a GUI for compressing images via PCA and SVD.  
See `image_compression/README.md` for more.

### 3. face_recognition
Scripts for face recognition using PCA and SVD, covering both training and testing.  
See `face_recognition/README.md` for specific instructions.

## Getting Started

**Requirements:**
- MATLAB (R2019b or newer recommended)
- Image Processing Toolbox (for full features)

**General Steps:**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nitir4/Linear-Algebra-Matlab.git
   ```
2. Open MATLAB and set your working directory to the folder you want (`noise_filtering`, `image_compression`, or `face_recognition`).
3. See each folder's README for how to run the scripts or GUIs.

Feel free to explore, and experiment on these projects for your own learning or research as that was the goal while creating them. If you have any ideas or feedback, I’d love to hear from you!
Thank you!
